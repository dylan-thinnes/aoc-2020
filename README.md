My solutions to Advent of Code, 2020.

Ground rules:

1. Must do all days in different languages, except those days which continue
   from other days' solutions (e.g. IntCode computer, 2019)
2. If I do a day in multiple different languages, I can "pick" the language for
   that day, as long as the resulting picks adhere to rule 1.
3. If I wish to use a language that I have already used, I can go back and redo
   the day that language was done in, using a different language, thus freeing
   it up for the new day.
4. Languages cannot be too similar, keeping in spirit of the rules (e.g.
   bash/zsh, typescript/javascript, haskell/purescript [controversial, I know])
5. I may write preprocessors to transform the input into something palatable to
   the language (e.g. Day 3 for J)
